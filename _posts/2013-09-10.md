Yesterday and today were still on my nightmare AZPC bug but I finally found and fixed the problem, woot.

The problem was that we generate synthetic mouse events when recieving touch events, however the event targetting code has checks in place to ensure that we only retarget events that were originally touch events (https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/master/layout/base/PositionedEventTargeting.cpp#L319) however the events we were firing (https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/master/dom/ipc/TabChild.cpp#L1697) never defined their input source which defaults to mouse (https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/master/dom/base/nsDOMWindowUtils.cpp#L694)

The fix ended up relatively simple (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=900638) despite wasting a week trying to find the bug.

By the side I also learnt that I need

    adb shell setprop net.dns1 10.0.2.3

To let the simulator get on the internet, and that I hate both C++ and IPDL
