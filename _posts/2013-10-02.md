More gdb fun today, so if you want to have a breakpoint inside Javascript, call `Math.sin(0, 0, 0)` in your code and break on `js::math_sin`, the weird function calls stop the result from being cached which makes sure the call hits the implementation which we are breaking on.

Finally got patches up for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=923081 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=915137, latter is a tiny gaia fix, the first is slightly more serious in that we are duplicating context menu events across out of process frames so both the parent and the child get their own event. This doesnt seem to cause any use visible bugs yet, but very confusing behaviour
