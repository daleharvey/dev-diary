I forgot to update this at all last week, I am pretty sure I did work but I dont have anything to show for it, weeks like that suck.

Today I was trying to figure out why when we trigger context menu events inside browser content the system app also recieves one, this would usually be due to us forgetting to stopPropogation() somewhere, however from the logs it looks like the event is getting sent independently via the platforms event manager, which is scary.

However instead of debugging this I had decided my tree was a bit out of date and did a git pull, assuming the build dependancies have changed and this meant I needed to spend hours installing new xcode and fixing python issues (brew really didnt want to update python), every time this happens it ends up in the best part of a day wasted.

To go along with that after I got everything working my builds took a very long time

```
real 61m42.144s 
user 2m44.496s 
sys 2m8.158s
```

This had a 2 line change taking an hour to build which makes debugging ... problematic, after a restart these came down to 20 minutes which still isnt ideal.

On the plus side I found http://dxr.mozilla.org/ which looks like an awesome replacement for http://mxr.mozilla.org/
