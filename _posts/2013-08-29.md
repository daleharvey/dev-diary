I reviewed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898326, I like the technique of using `[disabled=disabled] { pointer-events: none; }` to fully disable buttons that have event listeners.

I seen mentioned that the `unagi` device will soon be end of lifed as we switch to ICS Strawberry due to WebGL support so I have started looking more at using my Nexus4 for dev, filed 2 fairly big bugs which get in the way:

 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910706 - Most devices we can `make reset-gaia` to flash a new front end to the device and it boots up, the Nexus4 needs an additional `adb reboot`

 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910707 - The bottom toolbar / dock applications arent visible.

Now working on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=900638, Event fluffing means that if the user taps on a webpage with links on it and misses the link it automatically clicks the closest link, it needs to not break web content code with event listeners as well not break existing gesture code, This procedure currently works for normal content (web apps), however is broken for content that has "Async pan and zoom (APZC)" enabled. APZC is a feature that lets us have much smoother scrolling, however it means input events need to go through a seperate path.

To debug C++ issues in Gecko I just spit out log messages with

```
#include <android/log.h>
__android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_INFO, "GeckoWTF", "Some text");
```

Which is nasty and will crash on the desktop, but works fine on device, I really wish there was an easy way to turn arbitrary objects to strings though. (like `console.log(object)`)

I didnt get much done on this apart from trying to understand the path events flow through firefox internally.

Also reviewed a patch for PouchDB adding support for credentialed urls in the HTTP adapater which was mostly good, just needed a few code style nits fixed (https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/914)
