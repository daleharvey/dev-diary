Today I am mostly trying to run tests and filing bugs about how the various test platforms are broken

 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912026 - Mochitests is the platform most firefox tests are written in, they arent running for me

 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911866 - Developing the gaia integration tests sucks because you cant make single changes and rebuild the application, requires a full rebuild and the only easy way to do that run the entire test suite

 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912021 - When running the integration tests the UI is invisible, makes life harder
