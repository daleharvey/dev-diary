After asking people one too many questions repeatedly after forgetting how to do something, I have decided to start my `dev diary`. The idea is to keep notes of my development so I can look back on them, it may be incomprehensible garbage, it may be a useful insight into the day to day of an Open Source developer, who knows!

Today I worked on getting the first set of browser integration tests working (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=905916). James helped write the framework and helpfully write the first test for us, it worked on OSX but failed on Ubuntu.

My Ubuntu laptop seems to have a broken touchpad so had to set up a virtualbox instance which seems to work a lot less well than it used to, the copy and paste and resolution guest additions in particular. However worked well enough and I reproduced the failure we were seeing on Ubuntu, it looked like a race so I added a bunch of `client.helper.wait(1000)` in there and it started passing, turned out OSX was running the test slow enough to allow the browser to complete its lazy loading of the DOM, but Ubuntu tried running the test before the Browser was ready, I ended up just adding a `loaded` class to the document when it was ready to run and added a `client.helper.waitForElement('body.loaded')` to the test, Everything passed and that got merged.

Quite happy about this as we have a severe lack of integration tests and it makes basic regressions far too easy in the Browser, we will be adding tests with most new patches so hoping to get a lot more stable a lot quicker now.

I also worked on trying to get a working camera to debug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898326 however that ended up spending a lot of time and not getting very far, the Camera has been very unstable for me recently so may need to spend some time to look into it.
