I managed to break my 'per day' posting for this diary, but half expected, I will probably take it a while for it to become a habit (if ever).

Today I found out about `fprintf_stderr()` which will let me log in a way that works on both android and desktop without including any headers or breaking either platform, so that was nice.

I eventually found existing tests for event fluffing (after writing my own) @ https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/master/layout/base/tests/test_event_target_radius.html. These fail against my build which is strange as they pass in tbpl, I need to investigate but first I have been attempting to run them on a device.

I should be able to use these tests and turn APZC on (via `SpecialPowers.setBoolPref('layers.async-pan-zoom.enabled', true);`) to test [my bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=900638), currently I dont seem to be able to run [mochitests against a remote device](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Automated_testing/Mochitests) if I have overridden GECKO_PATH to a custom Gecko, so rebuilding inside the B2G checkout. I have been waiting on builds for around 5 hours today, I need a new machine. (after I wrote this I realised B2G is still defaulting to b2g18 which apparently doesnt support `./mach`, so make that 8 hours)

I merged a PR for PouchDB which fixed a rather dumb mistake (https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/commit/a1448f1e5e28929ae4c4b14249717fe22e42e9b0) and reviewed another which improved the build process but needs a few follow ons.

Also agreed to teach a workshop to help students get started contributing to Open Source at my old uni.
