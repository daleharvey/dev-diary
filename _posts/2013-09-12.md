Getting sick of the amount of time it takes to build gecko on my machine (11" Macbook Air) need a replacement, likely a 13" Macbook Pro

Reviewed an update to https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/929 and required some changes, I worry about review which are small in which I mostly write out the full patch as part of the review, I could always just commit myself but I think it helps contributors to be able to start and finish the patch themselves (at least I have had it help me).

Managed to get a patch in review @ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911195, was right yesterday about the cause of the problem, creating the patch mostly consisted of Ben Turner telling me what code to write but learnt a ton.

When need to push to try and already have a patch applied, I need to do 

    $ hg strip 'roots(outgoing())' && rm -rf .hg/patches

To get rid of the old patch, its probably completely the wrong way but seems to work.
