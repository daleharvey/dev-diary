I had to push yesterdays patch to our try server (runs tests and ensures we didnt break anything), I always forget the hg dance so recording it

    $ hg pull -u 
    $ hg qimport -P ~/src/Patches/900638.patch
    $ hg qref --message "try: -b o -p all -u all -t none"
    $ hg push -f ssh://dharvey%40mozilla.com@hg.mozilla.org/try/

With that we get https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=929f9cf1350a, when all the things go green its ready to land.

Reviewed Pull requests for PouchDB

 * https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/925 - First time contributor, we dont have a test harness for chrome apps and its a relatively simple change so merged

 * https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/920 - This change has been around a while, had some review comments that were addressed, there was a small mistake in the PR but I fixed it while committing as I dont like PR's hanging around for too long. The author has had quite a few commits so I added them as a contributor.

 * https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/914 + https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/927 both address the same problem, the first needed some follow ups but the second method is cleaner but broke an undocumented API.

After the patch I mentioned earlier went green, I pushed it to mozilla inbound, just since I always forget the url, recording here

    $ hg push ssh://dharvey%40mozilla.com@hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound

Spent a little time looking at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911195, fairly sure it has been caused by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906901 which moved the event.detail creation into C++, the object we get in browser.js is an XrayWrapper object which is some weird object that web content doesnt have access to, should be fairly easy to unwrap or properly compartmentalise the object, but I dont know how, maybe in the morning.
