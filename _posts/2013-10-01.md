Today I had fun learning gdb (working on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=915137), first remember you need a debug build, then several hours later you need to push gdbserver to the device

    $ adb push ./out//target/product/generic/obj/EXECUTABLES/gdbserver_intermediates/gdbserver /system/bin

Then I tried `./run-gdb.sh`, this didnt seem to work however as mentioned on IRC

    $ ./run-gdb.sh attach $(adb shell b2g-ps | awk '/b2g/ { print $3 }')

Worked nicely, then using

    (gdb) b nsEventStateManager.cpp:1666
    ... do something that triggers breakpoint
    (gdb) bt

I got a backtrace at the point I wanted, the backtrace didnt include the source of the event I was looking for as it had been posted to the event loop so needed to find the source of the event posted to the event loop and repeat.

At this point I am mostly doing remote debugging for kats which is nice as I get to learn a ton and without the help I am pretty much stuck here, hopefully it saves kats some time by just being able to tell what to look at / backtrace.

Also reviewed + merged a bunch of pull requests to PouchDB

There was another that was closed as it fixed the same bug, the one that was committed was cleaner and better tested though, feels bad when 2 people work on the same bug at the same time, but all ended well. Was really impressed as the PR's all came with tests where applicable and correct commit message formatting etc.

Also from last week I forgot to mention I started a new project, I dont have time for a new project but trying to figure out how to make this one to not need any maintenace, it may emd up being a 'campaign' as opposed to a project, but its to help first time contributors get patches into Open Source projects, for now there is just a questionnaire - http://goodfirstpatch.com/

Just realised I didnt post for 2 weeks, not one week, shall do better.
