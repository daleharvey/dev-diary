I am experimenting with using a browserify based approach to testing PouchDB, the current method requires some confusing juggling when using the browser vs node.js. Substack has a project (tape)[https://github.com/substack/tape] that is well integrated with both node + browser code, its missing a few features so last week I wrote (wrapping-tape)[https://github.com/daleharvey/wrapping-tape] to add setup and teardown functionality and today I wrote (browserify-getopts)[https://github.com/daleharvey/browserify-getopts] that simplifies passing arguments into tests whether in the browser or in node.

Currently the new test framework is working very well in node, however its quite inconvinient in the browser, there is a nice test runner in (testling)[https://github.com/substack/testling] however it is broken on OSX and it cant handle a variety of ways in which I need to test, it shouldnt be that hard to write an alternative though.

There was a pull request to look over in https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/pull/920, it add support for pruning PouchDB builds by specifically including only the plugins / adapters needed, it looks nice but crodjer mentioned he has thought of a better way, so leaving it for that.

Also merged a pull request to add `skip` support for allDocs and views in PouchDB(https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/commit/e1b976de852955e02edf5f590b41ac0296afad5f), the code was good but showed that we need to do some additional work to reduce duplication in code across adapters.

I spent the rest of the time converting the basic test suite into the new test format based off tape, the tests are nicer (https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/blob/master/test/integration/basics_test.js vs https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/blob/master/tests/test.basics.js), I also tried reproducing a test failure that has been reported but no luck. This was a bit of a day wasted with "busy work"
